# How to Run Locally
This was created using Flask so Python and other pre-requisite libraries are needed to run it locally. Here's how:
1. Install any 3.x version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Create and activate a virtual environment

You'll have to execute Python from command line, use the `-m` switch to target a module, then `venv` as the module you want, and finally point to the path and name for your virtual environment (you can name it whatever you want)

Example: `python -m venv ./env`

3. Install the requirements

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run `python app.py` from within the app's root directory

5. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
